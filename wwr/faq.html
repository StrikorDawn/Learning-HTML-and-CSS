            Is this a good trip for kids?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have
            found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more
            overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are
            all over 8).

            What are the age ranges you allow?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be
            bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with
            very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through
            are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what
            you might see around any corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each
            boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river
            guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling
            stories...some of which are even true!

          <p>
            As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
            element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
            certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
            years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns
            and injuries that occur on land.

          <p>
            Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life
            vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on
            rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in
            depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining
            what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of
            the raft.

              Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!
            </h5>
            <p>Let's describe a common day on the river...</p>
            <p>
              Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent
              sleeping under a beautiful starry sky.
            </p>

            <p>
              Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or
              omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids,
              calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food.
            </p>
            <p>
              We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you
              can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or
              explore around camp while your guides prepare your
              dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled
              salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven
              brownies.
            </p>
            <p>
              After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to
              talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed
              under more stars than you thought were possible.

            If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in
            advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually
            sufficient.
