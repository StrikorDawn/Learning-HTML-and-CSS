      <h1>Your not the only one who's asked</h1>
      <p>Q. Could i pay you in exposure</p>
      <p>
        A. No exposure does not pay the bills. You are paying for my skill and
        knowledge on the product/ subject.
      </p>
      <p>Q. What do you provide?</p>
      <p>
        A. As a growing artist, I provide concept art (such as references), YCH
        art work, personal illustrations, Vtube model illustrations, as well as
        rigging.
      </p>
      <p>Q. How do you price your commissions?</p>
      <p>
        A. Projects will be charged based on my knowledge on how to do it, my
        experience, as well as time. Other factors include the complexity of
        your model/ illustration.
      </p>
      <p>Q. What is your artstyle?</p>
      <p>A. My art style is a manga/ anime style.</p>
      <p>Q. What is the run time on my commission</p>
      <p>
        A. Depends on the project type, how detailed or complex you want your
        commission to be.
      </p>
      <p>Q. Will you do NSFW?</p>
      <p>
        A. <b>I do not</b> and <b>WILL NOT do NSFW</b> illustrations or models.
        I will redirect you to other artists for that request
      </p>
      <p>Q. How do I get in contact with you?</p>
      <p>
        A. You can <b>directly</b> contact me at hazelartzs@gmail.com as well as
        find me at my various social media sites at the bottom of the page for
        more examples of my work. I will not answer to DMâ€™s on those various
        platforms.
      </p>

      <h3><b>What questions can be answered?</b></h3>
      <p>
        They can expect to know a ball park on price they will pay for the art.
        Who Hazel_Arts is, what she does, and what her insperations for her
        peices are. Ways to contact and request things to be created, and
        estimated times for there compleation.
      </p>
      <h3><b>What info is required to compleate actions?</b></h3>
      <p>
        There will be an account system created. Most if not all orders will be
        done through the UI on the requests page, where contact info and
        description/concepts of the item to be made will need to be
        supplied/refferenced. An understanding that this is a buisness and that
        things will not be free.
